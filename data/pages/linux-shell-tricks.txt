====== Shell-tricks ======

various tricks shells

===== Execute a command in the background and detach it from the shell =====

This trick is useful for commands in a ssh connection because the command persist even if the ssh connection is closed or if CTRL+C is pressed.\\
This is mainly achieved by putting the output of the command in a temporary file and accessing that file by tail with the follow option -f

==== The TESTED script (not-oneline): ====
>TEMP_LOG_FILE=tmp.log

>nohup ./process &> "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" & tail -f "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" &

To restart a closed script:\\
Go in the directory in which the script was started and execute\\
>tail -f tmp.log

==== The NOT TESTED script (oneliner) ====
>TEMP_LOG_FILE=tmp.log;nohup ./process &> "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" & tail -f "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" &

The process of restarting a closed script is the same as described above
