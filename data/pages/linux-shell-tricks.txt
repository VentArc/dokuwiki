====== Shell-tricks ======

various tricks shells

===== Execute a command in the background and detach it from the shell =====

This trick is useful for commands in a ssh connection because the command persist even if the ssh connection is closed or if CTRL+C is pressed.\\
This is mainly achieved by putting the output of the command in a temporary file and accessing that file by tail with the follow option -f

==== The TESTED script (not-oneline): ====
  TEMP_LOG_FILE=tmp.log
  
  nohup ./process &> "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" & tail -f "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" &

To restart a closed script:\\
Go in the directory in which the script was started and execute\\
  tail -f tmp.log

==== The NOT TESTED script (oneliner) ====
  TEMP_LOG_FILE=tmp.log;nohup ./process &> "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" & tail -f "$TEMP_LOG_FILE" &

The process of restarting a closed script is the same as described above

===== Remove all the files in a parent directory =====

If you have a parent directory that contains a set of files and the child directory contains a subset of the parent directory files and you want to remove the files that the parent directory and the child directory contains from  the parent directory this is the script for you.

TLDR: example environment
  mkdir a; cd a/
  touch 1.mp4
  touch 2.mp4
  touch 3.mp4
  mkdir aa; cd aa/
  touch 1.mp4
  touch 2.mp4
  for i in *.mp4; do rm ../"$i"; done
    
  result:
  cd a/aa; ls -> 1.mp4 2.mp4
  cd ..; ls   -> 3.mp4
    
==== The TESTED script (online) ====

  for i in *.mp4; do rm ../"$i";done


===== Change fan speed in asus laptops =====

From the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fan_speed_control#Kernel_modules|archlinux wiki]] \\
All this commands need root access
  echo 255 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1           # Full fan speed (Value: 255)
  echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1             # Fan is stopped (Value: 0)
  echo 2 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1_enable     # Change fan mode to automatic
  echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1_enable      # Change fan mode to manual 
  echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1_enable      # Change fan mode to full speed
