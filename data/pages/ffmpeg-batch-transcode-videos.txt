====== Batch transcode videos with ffmpeg ======

for now there is just one, but hopefully i will add more

===== CPU_ENCODING Script to convert ALL file in the same level directory to H.264. =====

This script is tested and it works, **however it requires all file to transcode in the same directory AND a directory "newfiles"**.
The preset can be modified in order to speed up the encoding or slow it down to obtain better quality footage

==== The TESTED script (not-oneline): ====
  mkdir newfiles
  for i in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 20 -c:a aac -b:a 128k "newfiles/${i%.*}.mp4"; done

==== The UNTESTED script (oneline): ====
this should remove the need to create a directory "newfiles"

  mkdir newfiles; for i in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 20 -c:a aac -b:a 128k "newfiles/${i%.*}.mp4"; done



===== iGPU_ENCODING Script to convert ALL file in the same level directory to H.264. =====

-qp: quality of encoding lower is better and more slow\\
-bf: default is 2 

==== The TESTED script (not-oneline): ====
  mkdir newfiles
  for i in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_output_format vaapi -i "$i" -c:v h264_vaapi -qp 21 -bf 2  "newfiles/${i%.*}.mp4"; done
